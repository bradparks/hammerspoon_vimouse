WORK IN PROGRESS: Move your mouse with your keyboard, using vi keystrokes and a visual grid

To use, save to your hammerspoon extensions in a folder named `vimouse`

Activate using `CMD+G` as a toggle to hide/show the grid. 
Move using Ctrl+JKLM, and grid movement is in progress based off of letters displayed in the grid.
